# 🚗 YOLOv8 Video Object Detection App

This project is a **Streamlit-powered web application** that performs **real-time object detection on uploaded videos** using the **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** model from Ultralytics.

You can upload any video (e.g., with people, cars, dogs, buses), and the app will annotate and return a processed video with detected objects!
